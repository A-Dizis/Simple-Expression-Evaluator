# Simple-Expression-Evaluator
**Simple Expression Evaluator in Python**


*-->This is a simple numerical expression evaluator, built with python.*

*-->I implement the Shunting Yard Algorithm by Edgar Dijkstra.*

*-->More funtionality is expected to be added to make this a small handy utility and tool in assisting numerical computation.*

    Example input form:
    ----------------------
    (sin(2*3.145159)+2/3-1/3-1/3*(cos(3.14159-0)*1+3)-4)/2
